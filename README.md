# Plant Genome Visualization R Shiny App

## Overview
The Plant Genome Visualization app is an interactive tool built with R Shiny, designed to facilitate the exploration and analysis of plant genomic data. It provides a user-friendly interface for visualizing genomic variants and phylogenetic trees, aiding researchers in the field of plant genomics.

## Features
- **Genome Visualization**: Users can upload VCF files to visualize genomic variants. The app displays the data in an interactive table and as a scatter plot, highlighting the positions of variants across chromosomes.
- **Phylogenetic Analysis**: This section allows for the upload and visualization of phylogenetic trees, helping users to interpret evolutionary relationships.
- **Interactive Tables**: The app uses the DT package to create tables that users can sort, filter, and search through, providing a detailed view of the genomic data.
- **Responsive Layout**: Built with `shinydashboard`, the app offers a clean and modern dashboard layout that is responsive and accessible on various devices.

## Installation
Before running the app, install the required R packages using the following command:
```r
install.packages(c("shiny", "shinydashboard", "ggplot2", "VariantAnnotation", "GenomicRanges", "DT", "ape"))
```

## Running the App
To launch the app, clone the repository and run the following command in R:
```r
shiny::runApp('PlantGenomeViz')
```
Make sure to set the working directory to the location of the cloned repository.
